We all know that farming relies on soil and weather conditions. Sometimes, unexpected changes like unusual rainfall, heat waves, or humidity fluctuations can hurt farmers' yields. This stops them from using their land effectively. To tackle this, I've created a Machine Learning Model. It helps farmers optimize their production. This model predicts which crop is best for a certain soil and climate. This way, we can assist farmers in making better harvest choices.

I have considered seven crucial elements that will assist us in precisely ascertaining the optimal choice of crops and the suitable timing for their cultivation. These factors encompass the levels of Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium present in the soil, the prevailing temperature measured in degrees Celsius, humidity, pH, and the amount of rainfall measured in millimeters.

Tools utilized:- Python & Jupyter Notebook Libraries used: Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, ipywidgets and sklearn. Machine Learning Algorithms applied: Clustering Analysis and Logistic Regression.
